title: My Post
date: 2023-06-12
This is my first blog post. Why is this called a post. The only post I have known for a long time is when a man on a cycle visits you with a letter, a money order, a telegram, or a parcel. 
That man has very little significance now. Nobody has the patience to wait for the post. They would rather have things done online
And if they do need a physical delivery, they would opt for a courier service, and get your delivery anytime through the day or even late evening. No longer do we look forward to a particular time when the postman does his rounds.
